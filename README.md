# WordScape_Solution
## This is a solution for the game "Wordscape" which can be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peoplefun.wordcross)

This is a python script and uses the file from /usr/share/dict/words to find the corresponding words 
It generates all the possible outcomes of the given letters, then removes all the combinations which have
less than three letters, since the game doesn't allow it. 

# Running the script
You can just download the py script and the all_words.txt file and run it in python interpreter

### Enjoy the game...
